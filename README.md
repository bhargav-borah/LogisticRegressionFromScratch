# LogisticRegressionFromScratch

This repository contains the implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of Logistic Regression without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

## Blog Post

For a detailed step-by-step explanation of the implementation, you can refer to the [blog post](https://medium.com/@bhargavborah020/logistic-regression-step-by-step-guide-to-implementation-from-scratch-d8661b0cb3a0) that accompanies this code.


## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a popular statistical method for binary classification problems. This project demonstrates how to build a Logistic Regression model from the ground up, explaining the mathematics behind it and providing a clear Python implementation.
